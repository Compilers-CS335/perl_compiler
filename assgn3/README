# Perl Compiler
A cross-compiler from 'perl' to 'x86' using 'python'

Part3: run: python parser.py test/<file_name>

--------------------------------------------------
VARIATIONS IN IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------
> not giving zero integer value to strings. 
> Multiple assignments in a single statement are now not allowed
> Functions do not take parameters. Since any variable defined WITHOUT "my" can be used by any function.
> also, array can only be accessed using @array_name[index] ... and not $array_name[index]



--------------------------------------------------
UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES 
--------------------------------------------------
> ++ and -- not implemented
> Hash (%hashName) not implemented
> repeat does not create arrays (i.e. only strings can be repeated)
> The update assignment in FOR loops cannot take any variable in the RHS. ($a = $a+1 might not work correctly if $a has been modified inside the loop)
> Array assignment :-   @array_name = (...);   -: is mandatory
> Can't use the following names for functions:- parent, root, type, scope, returntype, scope_depth
> Can't call functions by &function_name.
> Functions cannot be called before definition.

-------------------------------------------------
COMMENT
-------------------------------------------------
> Only basic features have been implemented.
> Most of the features that work in C are implemented. Perl is a very vast language, and similar things can be done in various ways.
